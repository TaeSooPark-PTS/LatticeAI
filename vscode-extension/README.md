Lattice AI connects VS Code, Cursor, and VSCodium to your local-first Digital
Brain. Use it to send files into durable Brain context, work with Brain-backed
chat, run model workflows, and trigger coding actions from the editor.

## Current Release

**6.2.0 — Product Decomposition / Release Smoke Automation.** The extension follows
the main app positioning: Lattice AI is a local-first Digital Brain, not just a
model launcher or editor chat panel. It connects editor actions to the same
durable Brain context, explicit consent gates, replaceable model workflow, and
separated Admin surface used by the desktop app. The v6.2 line keeps the v6.1
product hardening baseline while splitting large app/onboarding surfaces,
strengthening consent/i18n coverage, shrinking root legacy modules, and adding
release smoke automation.

## Quick Start

Install and start the Lattice AI workspace:

```bash
pip install ltcai
LTCAI
```

For Apple Silicon local model support:

```bash
pip install "ltcai[local]"
```

Then install the extension:

- [VS Code Marketplace: parktaesoo.ltcai](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=parktaesoo.ltcai)
- [Open VSX: parktaesoo.ltcai](https://open-vsx.org/extension/parktaesoo/ltcai)

The extension auto-connects to `http://localhost:4825`.

  retained as a text fallback only for standard Gemma 4 metadata.
- LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp, and Ollama-compatible local paths.
- OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, Together AI, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- Model cards disclose maker country, maker company, run mode, internet usage,
  model name, HF verification status, download/load strategy, and hardware fit.
