**Your model is the voice you use today. Your Brain is the asset you keep.**

**모델은 갈아타도, 내 지식은 내 컴퓨터에 남는 로컬 우선 AI 브레인.**

![v9.9.0 Living Brain walkthrough](output/release/v9.9.0/gifs/v9.9.0-living-brain-walkthrough.gif)

Chat, files, folders, notes, and web pages all flow into one durable knowledge
graph on your computer. Any model — local MLX or cloud — can speak with that
memory. Nothing leaves your machine without explicit consent.

대화·파일·폴더·웹페이지가 전부 내 컴퓨터 안의 지식 그래프로 쌓이고, 어떤
모델이든 그 기억을 이어받아 대화합니다.

## What You Can Do

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Chat with a Brain that remembers** — every conversation grows durable, source-linked memory ![Brain Chat](output/release/v9.9.0/screenshots/04-brain-chat-home.png) | **See how knowledge connects** — a real relationship graph, not a file list ![Memory Graph](output/release/v9.9.0/screenshots/05-memory-graph.png) |
| **Capture anything** — files, whole folders, notes, screenshots, web pages ![Capture](output/release/v9.9.0/screenshots/06-capture.png) | **Automate with review** — agent changes become proposals you approve first ![Review Center](output/release/v9.9.0/screenshots/12-review-center.png) |
| **Pick a model in one click** — recommended local models for your hardware ![Recommended Models](output/release/v9.9.0/screenshots/02-recommended-models.png) | **Stay in control** — audit, roles, retention in a separate admin surface ![Admin Console](output/release/v9.9.0/screenshots/10-admin-console.png) |

## Why Lattice AI

- **Own your memory** — knowledge lives in a local SQLite Brain you can back up,
  export, inspect, and restore (`.latticebrain` encrypted archive).
- **Model-independent** — switch between local MLX models and cloud models
  without rebuilding context from zero.
- **Honest by design** — the Brain tells you when retrieval context is limited,
  when captured pages extracted poorly, and when the vector index is catching up.
- **Safe automation** — automations are consent-first drafts; edits to existing
  content always pass through a reviewable proposal with a diff.

매번 AI에게 프로젝트 맥락을 다시 설명하고 있다면, 지식이 여러 서비스에 흩어져
있다면, 그 기억을 특정 회사가 아니라 내가 소유하고 싶다면 — Lattice AI가 그
브레인입니다.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install ltcai        # or: npm install -g ltcai
LTCAI                    # then open http://127.0.0.1:4825/app
```

Apple Silicon local models: `pip install "ltcai[local]"`. Desktop app (Tauri)
ships as a dmg on each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/TaeSooPark-PTS/LatticeAI/releases).

First-run flow — wake the Brain, pick the owner, load a recommended model:

## Current Release

The current release is **9.9.0 — Fail-Closed Trust**:

- **Change proposals can't clobber your edits.** A proposal now records the
  original content hash; if the file changed before you approve, the apply is
  rejected with a conflict instead of silently overwriting your work, and the
  write is atomic. Duplicate/concurrent approvals apply exactly once.
- **A confused verifier never reports success.** If the agent's critic output
  can't be parsed (after one strict retry), the run ends as `NEEDS_REVIEW`
  instead of a fabricated "done"; completion now requires a valid PASS *and*
  real execution evidence.
- **Every mutating tool is governed.** A single-source inventory classifies
  each side-effecting tool; a CI gate fails closed if a new mutator ships
  ungoverned, and tools that would overwrite existing content without a
  reviewable proposal are blocked rather than applied.
- **Honest onboarding.** Device analysis is modeled as
  `loading | ready | unavailable`; a failed probe no longer fabricates a
  "supported, ready on this computer" model card — it shows the cause, a
  retry, and "continue without a model."
- **Leaner & audited.** Initial JS bundle is ~22% smaller (lazy-loaded heavy
  views, with a CI budget), plus dependency/SBOM audit and scheduled
  PostgreSQL integration workflows, a security-scan report, a model benchmark
  harness, and current/architecture documentation classification.

Release notes: [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) · Full history: [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md)

Expected artifacts for 9.9.0 release must use exact filenames:

- `dist/ltcai-9.9.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- `dist/ltcai-9.9.0.tar.gz`
- `ltcai-9.9.0.tgz`
- `dist/ltcai-9.9.0.vsix`
- `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/Lattice AI_9.9.0_aarch64.dmg`

Do not use wildcard artifact uploads. Package registry publishing remains owner-run.

## Architecture At A Glance

FastAPI on localhost is the source of truth; the React/Vite frontend and the
Tauri desktop shell sit on top; the independent `lattice_brain` package owns
the graph, memory, ingestion, and portability. Local-first by default — cloud
calls, downloads, Telegram, and update checks are opt-in.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for details and
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the developer workflow
(`npm install && npm run dev`, validation via `npm run lint`,
`npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:visual`).

## Known Limitations

- External package registries are owner-published and can lag behind GitHub.
- PostgreSQL/pgvector is optional scale/migration tooling. SQLite remains the
  live local Brain store in 9.9.0.
- Docker, model downloads, cloud model calls, Telegram, Brain Network, and
  update checks require explicit user action.
- Conversation does not fabricate answers when no model is loaded. Agent and
  workflow simulation without a loaded LLM is deterministic and LLM-free (it
  does not call a model) — labeled as such, never presented as autonomous
  model success.
